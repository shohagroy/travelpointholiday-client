            You'll receive a confirmation email once the reservation is
            confirmed with the attraction operator. This could take some time
            based on the supplier.

            You can view your tickets in your confirmation email or the Booking
            and Trips section of your account.

            Each digital ticket contains a unique code. This is usually a QR or
            numerical code, but could be something else and can be found on your
            ticket or the PDF sent to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your digital ticket contains a barcode or QR code, show it to the
            staff at the attraction's entrance or ticket collection point for
            them to scan.
          </p>

          <p>
            For those with numerical codes, show your ticket to staff for
            verification.
